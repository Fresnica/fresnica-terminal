# Fresnica Terminal Current State

Status: **architecture-convergence milestone implemented and validated; stacked Draft PRs remain unmerged and no release is planned yet**.

Last verified: 2026-09-06.

## Source of truth

- Current Terminal `main`: `ba7e24bbd3e6f527d4d56029a572ac8d6851015c`.
- Terminal v0.2.0 release commit: `a2485cad5d2d6048f8ffb6987597c2a3fca2670d`.
- Current Terminal product top: PR #19 `refactor/terminal-history-read-model@85fba1612ba7709a8040a0d1a1afc1011cd00d08`.
- Terminal #19 tree: `6f552cb7e9f1a4f12fea85309d9d4c9696a5364b`.
- Terminal Rust source pin: `Fresnica/fresnica@65a9da804ca16849e320d24365e6e839e62cf5d8`, the validated History implementation commit from upstream #167.
- Upstream #167 current head: `a63fc62a6289fc3b4696556eb436c9a0147feb96`. Its only change after the Terminal pin is the carried-forward `docs/capabilities/network.md` Rust-runtime scope correction; Rust source is unchanged.
- Upstream cumulative integration candidate: Draft PR #169, head `f01f6607bcd1cbf5e28de800ce215187bf23091f`, one commit directly on upstream `main`, with a tree byte-identical to #167 current top.

Repository source, exact branch heads and CI remain authoritative if this file later drifts.

## What this milestone was solving

The post-v0.2.0 work was not a feature race. It removed proven ownership leaks between Terminal presentation code and the reusable Rust capability client without inventing a second Application layer.

The target boundary is now:

```text
provider / protocol data
        |
        v
fresnica-client semantic capability models
        |
        +---------------------------+
        |                           |
        v                           v
Terminal machine output      Terminal human presentation
Fresnica-owned schema        CLI / TUI wording and compaction
```

Desktop or another Rust product may consume `fresnica-client` semantic DTOs directly. Terminal-specific English wording, abbreviations and layout are not shared API. Mobile/Web are not required to route their Application Capabilities through the Rust `fresnica-client` runtime.

## Implemented Draft stack

The current Terminal stack is intentionally linear and unmerged:

1. **#11 — Classic authorization review**
   - consumes the shared prepared-transaction authorization snapshot;
   - CLI/TUI do not recalculate signer weights or thresholds;
   - submit remains authoritative and refreshes current ledger authorization.
2. **#12 — Network endpoint profile**
   - `--horizon-url` / `FRESNICA_HORIZON_URL` resolve into shared `NetworkProfile`;
   - Terminal does not construct provider gateways directly.
3. **#13 — Typed Account read model**
   - removes raw provider Account JSON from the Terminal boundary;
   - `account --json` is a deliberate Terminal/Fresnica machine schema derived from typed state.
4. **#14 — Typed Balance read model**
   - CLI/TUI consume `AssetBalance` / `BalanceAsset`;
   - exact asset identity and liabilities remain semantic data, not presentation parsing.
5. **#15 — Local/network initialization split**
   - `info`, `contact` and `wallet` remain usable without network-provider configuration;
   - network commands still fail closed on invalid network configuration.
6. **#16 — Watch-only registration ownership**
   - watch-only record construction moved behind the Rust Client Account/Wallet capability;
   - Terminal no longer directly depends on the SDK merely to assemble the record.
7. **#17 — Application passcode policy ownership**
   - current terminal/reference store-wide passcode execution moved out of CLI prompt code into Rust Client wallet helpers;
   - the policy remains implementation-specific, not a cross-platform normative contract.
8. **#18 — Restore signer compatibility ownership**
   - protected-signer restore revalidation moved behind the Rust Client wallet boundary;
   - path, prompt, rename, overwrite and output remain Terminal responsibilities.
9. **#19 — Typed History read model and Terminal presentation**
   - TUI stores `Vec<HistoryOperation>` rather than provider JSON;
   - CLI/TUI render typed History semantics;
   - a thin `fresnica-terminal-presentation` crate owns shared human-only History formatting;
   - `history --json` is generated directly from typed DTOs and does not pass through human presentation;
   - full account/asset identity remains available to other Rust consumers such as a future Desktop product.

The corresponding upstream Fresnica Rust-client work is a stacked Draft line through #167. One parent-layer drift was found during closeout: #157 received a documentation-only Network runtime-scope correction after #159 had already forked. That exact correction was carried to #167 top as `a63fc62a6289fc3b4696556eb436c9a0147feb96`; Required CI #92 passed. No other parent-head drift was found in #159 -> #167.

## Validation at the current tops

Terminal #19 exact head `85fba1612ba7709a8040a0d1a1afc1011cd00d08` has passed:

- disposable exact-tree verifier run `34034699994`;
- formal CI #58 / run `34034975664`: repository boundary, rustfmt, workspace clippy with warnings denied, workspace tests, CLI/TUI release builds and RefPython compatibility;
- Release Terminal #37 / run `34034975655`: validate, Linux x64 package, macOS arm64 package, Windows x64 package and Windows release-binary smoke;
- PR publish step correctly skipped.

Upstream History implementation commit `65a9da804ca16849e320d24365e6e839e62cf5d8` passed Required CI #89 / run `34034280333`.

Upstream #167 current head `a63fc62a6289fc3b4696556eb436c9a0147feb96` passed Required CI #92 / run `34038000875` after the carried-forward architecture document correction.

No merge or release is part of this milestone closeout.

## Self-check conclusions

The current top tree was re-audited after #19 against the shared-foundation placement rule.

- Account, Balance and History no longer require Terminal to interpret provider-shaped read records.
- DEX order book, offers, pair trades, account fills and candles consume typed `fresnica-client` snapshots/models; Terminal owns parsing and rendering only.
- Anchor still contains substantial CLI-only orchestration and JSON input handling. This is an acknowledged exception, not a newly discovered ownership regression: there is still no second Terminal Anchor consumer or stronger shared contract evidence that justifies extracting another layer.
- The History `1..=200` limit is enforced by `FresnicaClient::history()` itself. Terminal's matching argument guard is user-facing validation rather than a provider-ownership leak. A test name still mentions Horizon page size; that wording alone does not justify a code PR.
- CLI and TUI authorization rendering intentionally differ in full-key versus compact-key presentation. Do not generalize the new History presentation crate into a universal formatter merely for symmetry.
- The cumulative Terminal diff from `main` to #19 is purely ahead, contains only expected product/document/formal-boundary files and no disposable verifier artifacts.
- The cumulative upstream diff is also purely ahead. The only discovered stacked-branch ancestry drift was the #157 documentation correction described above, and it is now present at the validated top.

No new blocking implementation defect remains from this audit.

## Milestone boundary

The architecture-convergence plan is **implemented**. Continuing to add refactor PRs merely because more code can be moved would violate the evidence-driven boundary used for this work.

The following are separate product/capability decisions, not unfinished cleanup in this milestone:

- richer transaction-grouped Activity, cache/cursors, spam classification and enrichment;
- Soroban invoke product input/review UX;
- generic Dapp/SEP-53 session transport;
- external Ledger hardware integration;
- Passkey / smart-account product paths;
- Anchor TUI parity;
- Horizon-to-RPC/provider migration beyond the semantic boundaries already prepared.

## Integration disposition

Do **not** merge the long stacked Draft PRs one by one as the primary integration path. Their purpose is architecture reasoning, surgical implementation and exact-slice CI evidence; the #157 -> #159 documentation fork demonstrates why a long mutable stack is a poor final merge unit.

Preferred integration shape:

1. preserve the stacked Draft PRs as evidence;
2. create one cumulative upstream integration commit directly on current upstream `main` using the validated #167 top tree — Draft PR #169 does this;
3. run formal CI on that cumulative upstream candidate;
4. create one cumulative Terminal integration commit directly on current Terminal `main` using the validated #19 product tree plus this `CURRENT.md` closeout record;
5. keep the Terminal Rust source pin at the already validated `65a9da8...` during integration review because upstream `65a9da8... -> a63fc62...` changes documentation only;
6. after the upstream integration candidate is actually merged, repin Terminal once to the final upstream merged commit and rerun Terminal gates;
7. only then decide merge and release timing.

This avoids both stacked ancestry drift and pointless dependency-SHA churn during review.

Until that decision is made, do not publish a new Terminal release, start Soroban merely because the lower-level capability exists, or broaden the presentation crate without concrete duplicate responsibility that has the same presentation requirements.
